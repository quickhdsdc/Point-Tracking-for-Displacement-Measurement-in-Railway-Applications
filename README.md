# Point-Tracking-for-Displacement-Measurement-in-Railway-Applications
## Introduction
This is a repository of our paper "Deep Learning Based Virtual Point Tracking for Real-Time Target-less Dynamic Displacement Measurement in Railway Applications". 
The paper and code have been significantly revised. A preprint version can be found at https://www.researchgate.net/publication/348589285_REVISED_--_Deep_Learning_based_Virtual_Point_Tracking_for_Real-Time_Target-less_Dynamic_Displacement_Measurement_in_Railway_Applications.

The used pytorch version is 1.9. The used data for training and evaluation will be uploaded soon.
